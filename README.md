# konsole-material-color-scheme

Konsole is one of the best terminal emulators in the world. 
Here's material color scheme for it.

Usually konsole color schemes are placed inside ~/.local/share/konsole. 
Put ```Material.colorscheme``` there and set it as active theme:
Settings → Edit Current Profile → Appearance tab → Material

Thank you for your attention. Have fun.
